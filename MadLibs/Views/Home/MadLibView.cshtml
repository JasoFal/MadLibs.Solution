    <p>He sensed a @Model.NounOne drifting through the basement,</p>
    <p>soundless and @Model.AdjectiveOne, moving toward him. He turned</p>
    <p>and @Model.VerbOne up the stairs, taking them two at a</p>
    <p>time, landing heavily with each step. Crash, a board cracked, and Liam</p>
    <p>@Model.VerbTwo, slamming his shin hard against the wood. He</p>
    <p>grabbed the top step, catching himself before he fell. He wheezed, felt</p>
    <p>dizzy, woozy. Liam's @Model.AdjectiveTwo leg dangled in the air, kicking</p>
    <p>at nothingness. He felt a thin, @Model.Adverb grip around his</p>
    <p>ankle. Like a claw pulling, dragging him down. Liam yanked his leg free,</p>
    <p>lifted himself up, gasping for air, and @Model.VerbThree to the top</p>
    <p>of the stairs. He crawled into the @Model.NounTwo, into the light.</p>
    <p>He slammed the door shut behind him, twisting the lock, heart thundering.</p>
